```

Arguments:

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `null`): Force the value of the source ID.
- `max_blank` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `20.0`): Maximum duration of silence allowed, in seconds.
- `min_noise` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `0.0`): Minimum duration of noise required to end silence, in seconds.
- `on_noise` (of type `() -> unit`, which defaults to `{()}`): Handler called when noise is detected.
- `start_blank` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `false`): Start assuming we have blank.
- `threshold` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `-40.0`): Power in decibels under which the stream is considered silent.
- `track_sensitive` (of type `{bool}`, which defaults to `true`): Reset blank counter at each track.
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `() -> unit`): Handler called when blank is detected.
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `source(audio=pcm('a), 'b)`)

- `is_blank` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate whether blank was detected.

- `on_track` (of type `((([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on new tracks.
- `on_wake_up` (of type `((() -> unit)) -> unit`): Register a function to be called after the source is asked to get ready. This is when, for instance, the source's final ID is set.
- `register_command` (of type `(?usage : string?, description : string, string, ((string) -> string)) ->
unit`): Register a server command for this source. Command is registered under the source's id namespace when it gets up and de-registered when it gets down.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `reset_last_metadata_on_track` (of type `(() -> bool).{set : (bool) -> unit}`): If `true`, the source's `last_metadata` is reset on each new track. If a metadata is present along with the track mark, then it becomes the new `last_metadata`, otherwise, `last_metadata becomes `null`.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controlling its own real-time loop.
- `skip` (of type `() -> unit`): Skip to the next track.
- `time` (of type `() -> float`): Get a source's time, based on its assigned clock.

### `switch` {#switch}

At the beginning of a track, select the first source whose predicate is true.

Type:

```
(?id : string?, ?all_predicates : bool, ?override : string,
 ?replay_metadata : bool, ?single : [bool], ?track_sensitive : {bool},
 ?transition_length : float,
 ?transitions : [(source('a), source('a)) -> source('a)],
 [(() -> bool) * source('a)]) -> source('a)
```

Arguments:

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `null`): Force the value of the source ID.
- `all_predicates` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `false`): Always evaluate all predicates when re-selecting.
- `override` (of type `string`, which defaults to `"liq_transition_length"`): Metadata field which, if present and containing a float, overrides the `transition_length` parameter.
- `replay_metadata` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `true`): Replay the last metadata of a child when switching to it in the middle of a track.
- `single` (of type `[bool]`, which defaults to `[]`): Forbid the selection of a branch for two tracks in a row. The empty list stands for `[false,...,false]`.
- `track_sensitive` (of type `{bool}`, which defaults to `true`): Re-select only on end of tracks.
- `transition_length` (of type `float`, which defaults to `5.0`): Maximum transition duration.
- `transitions` (of type `[(source('a), source('a)) -> source('a)]`, which defaults to `[]`): Transition functions, padded with `fun (x,y) -> y` functions.
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `[(() -> bool) * source('a)]`): Sources with the predicate telling when they can be played.

Methods:

- `buffered` (of type `() -> [string * float]`): Length of buffered data.
- `clock` (of type `clock`): The source's clock
- `duration` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of the duration of the current track.
- `elapsed` (of type `() -> float`): Elapsed time in the current track.
- `fallible` (of type `bool`): Indicate if a source may fail, i.e. may not be ready to stream.
- `id` (of type `() -> string`): Identifier of the source.
- `is_active` (of type `() -> bool`): `true` if the source is active, i.e. it is continuously animated by its own clock whenever it is ready. Typically, `true` for outputs and sources such as `input.http`.
- `is_ready` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate if a source is ready to stream. This does not mean that the source is currently streaming, just that its resources are all properly initialized.
- `is_up` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate that the source can be asked to produce some data at any time. This is `true` when the source is currently being used or if it could be used at any time, typically inside a `switch` or `fallback`.
- `last_metadata` (of type `() -> [string * string]?`): Return the last metadata from the source.
- `log` (of type `{level : (() -> int).{set : (int) -> unit}}`): Get or set the source's log level, from `1` to `5`.
- `on_metadata` (of type `((([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on metadata packets.
- `on_shutdown` (of type `((() -> unit)) -> unit`): Register a function to be called when source shuts down.
- `on_track` (of type `((([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on new tracks.
- `on_wake_up` (of type `((() -> unit)) -> unit`): Register a function to be called after the source is asked to get ready. This is when, for instance, the source's final ID is set.
- `register_command` (of type `(?usage : string?, description : string, string, ((string) -> string)) ->
unit`): Register a server command for this source. Command is registered under the source's id namespace when it gets up and de-registered when it gets down.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `reset_last_metadata_on_track` (of type `(() -> bool).{set : (bool) -> unit}`): If `true`, the source's `last_metadata` is reset on each new track. If a metadata is present along with the track mark, then it becomes the new `last_metadata`, otherwise, `last_metadata becomes `null`.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `selected` (of type `() -> source('A)?`): Currently selected source.
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controlling its own real-time loop.
- `skip` (of type `() -> unit`): Skip to the next track.
- `time` (of type `() -> float`): Get a source's time, based on its assigned clock.
