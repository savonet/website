### `append` {#append}

Append an extra track to every track. Set the metadata ‘liq_append’ to `false` to inhibit appending on one track.

Type:

```
(?id : string?, ?insert_missing : bool, ?merge : bool, source('a),
 (([string * string]) -> source('a))) -> source('a)
where 'a is an orderable type
```

Arguments:

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `"append"`)
- `insert_missing` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `true`): Treat track beginnings without metadata as having empty one.
- `merge` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `false`): Merge the track with its appended track.
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `source('a) where 'a is an orderable type`): Given the metadata, build the source producing the track to append. The function can return `null` to prevent appending a new track.
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `([string * string]) -> source('a) where 'a is an orderable type`)

Methods:

- `buffered` (of type `() -> [string * float]`): Length of buffered data.
- `cancel_pending` (of type `() -> unit`): 
- `clock` (of type `clock`): The source's clock
- `duration` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of the duration of the current track.
- `elapsed` (of type `() -> float`): Elapsed time in the current track.
- `fallible` (of type `bool`): Indicate if a source may fail, i.e. may not be ready to stream.
- `generate_frame` (of type `() -> unit`): Generate a frame from the source without consuming it. This can be useful in advanced cases where generating a frame is required to trigger some side effect like calculating some metadata before making a decision. You should make sure that the source is available before calling this function and it should only be called inside synchronous streaming loop callback such as `on_frame`!
- `id` (of type `() -> string`): Identifier of the source.
- `insert_metadata` (of type `(?new_track : bool, [string * string]) -> unit`): Dynamically insert metadata in a stream. Inserts a new track with the given metadata if `new_track` is `true`.
- `is_active` (of type `() -> bool`): `true` if the source is active, i.e. it is continuously animated by its own clock whenever it is ready. Typically, `true` for outputs and sources such as `input.http`.
- `is_ready` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate if a source is ready to stream. This does not mean that the source is currently streaming, just that its resources are all properly initialized.
- `is_up` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate that the source can be asked to produce some data at any time. This is `true` when the source is currently being used or if it could be used at any time, typically inside a `switch` or `fallback`.
- `last_metadata` (of type `() -> [string * string]?`): Return the last metadata from the source.
- `log` (of type `{level : (() -> int).{set : (int) -> unit}}`): Get or set the source's log level, from `1` to `5`.
- `pending` (of type `() -> source('A)? where 'A is an orderable type`): 
- `register_command` (of type `(?usage : string?, description : string, string, ((string) -> string)) ->
unit`): Register a server command for this source. Command is registered under the source's id namespace when it gets up and de-registered when it gets down.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `reset_last_metadata_on_track` (of type `(() -> bool).{set : (bool) -> unit}`): If `true`, the source's `last_metadata` is reset on each new track. If a metadata is present along with the track mark, then it becomes the new `last_metadata`, otherwise, `last_metadata becomes `null`.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `selected` (of type `() -> source('A)? where 'A is an orderable type`): Currently selected source.
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controlling its own real-time loop.
- `self_sync_description` (of type `() -> string`): 
- `set_pending` (of type `(source('A)?) -> unit where 'A is an orderable type`): 
- `skip` (of type `(?cancel_pending : bool) -> unit`): 
- `time` (of type `() -> float`): Get a source's time, based on its assigned clock.

Callbacks:

- `on_frame` (of type `(?before : bool, synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on frame. When `before` is `true`, callback is executed before computing the frame and after otherwise
- `on_frame_checksum` (of type `(?before : ((string?) -> unit)?, synchronous : bool,
 ((cache : string?, string) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler Register callbacks to compute frame checksums for debugging purposes. This is useful to track frame content changes through the streaming pipeline. The `before` callback is called before computing the frame with the checksum of the cached frame (if any, `null` otherwise). The main callback is called after computing the frame with the checksum of the generated frame and the remaining cache (if any).
- `on_metadata` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to execute on each metadata
- `on_position` (of type `(position : {float}, ?remaining : bool, ?allow_partial : bool,
 synchronous : bool, ((float, [string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track position. If `remaining` is `false`, callback is executed when position in track is more or equal to `position`. If `remaining` is `true`, callback is executed when remaining time in the current track is less or equal to `position`. Keep in mind that elapsed time is exact while remaining time is always estimated. Remaining time is usually more accurate for file-based sources. When `allow_partial` is `true`, if the current track ends before the `offset` position is reached, callback is still executed
- `on_shutdown` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called when source shuts down
- `on_track` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track marks
- `on_wake_up` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called after the source is asked to get ready

This is useful to track frame content changes through the streaming pipeline.

The main callback is called after computing the frame with the checksum of the generated frame and the remaining cache (if any).
- `on_metadata` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to execute on each metadata

- `time` (of type `() -> float`): Get a source's time, based on its assigned clock.

Callbacks:

- `on_frame` (of type `(?before : bool, synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on frame. When `before` is `true`, callback is executed before computing the frame and after otherwise
- `on_frame_checksum` (of type `(?before : ((string?) -> unit)?, synchronous : bool,
 ((cache : string?, string) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler Register callbacks to compute frame checksums for debugging purposes. This is useful to track frame content changes through the streaming pipeline. The `before` callback is called before computing the frame with the checksum of the cached frame (if any, `null` otherwise). The main callback is called after computing the frame with the checksum of the generated frame and the remaining cache (if any).
- `on_metadata` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to execute on each metadata
- `on_position` (of type `(position : {float}, ?remaining : bool, ?allow_partial : bool,
 synchronous : bool, ((float, [string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track position. If `remaining` is `false`, callback is executed when position in track is more or equal to `position`. If `remaining` is `true`, callback is executed when remaining time in the current track is less or equal to `position`. Keep in mind that elapsed time is exact while remaining time is always estimated. Remaining time is usually more accurate for file-based sources. When `allow_partial` is `true`, if the current track ends before the `offset` position is reached, callback is still executed
- `on_shutdown` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called when source shuts down
- `on_track` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track marks
- `on_wake_up` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called after the source is asked to get ready
