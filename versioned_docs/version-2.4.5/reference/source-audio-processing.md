### `add` {#add}

Mix sources, with optional normalization. Only relay metadata from the first available source. Track marks are dropped from all sources.

Type:

```
(?id : string?, ?normalize : {bool}, ?power : {bool}, ?weights : [{float}],
 [source('a)]) -> source('a)
where 'a is a set of internal tracks
```

Arguments:

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `null`): Force the value of the source ID.
- `normalize` (of type `{bool}`, which defaults to `true`): Divide by the sum of weights of ready sources (or by the number of ready sources if weights are not specified).
- `power` (of type `{bool}`, which defaults to `false`): Perform constant-power normalization.
- `weights` (of type `[{float}]`, which defaults to `[]`): Relative weight of the sources in the sum. The empty list stands for the homogeneous distribution. These are used as amplification coefficients if we are not normalizing.
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `[source('a)] where 'a is a set of internal tracks`)

Methods:

- `buffered` (of type `() -> [string * float]`): Length of buffered data.
- `clock` (of type `clock`): The source's clock
- `duration` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of the duration of the current track.
- `elapsed` (of type `() -> float`): Elapsed time in the current track.
- `fallible` (of type `bool`): Indicate if a source may fail, i.e. may not be ready to stream.
- `generate_frame` (of type `() -> unit`): Generate a frame from the source without consuming it. This can be useful in advanced cases where generating a frame is required to trigger some side effect like calculating some metadata before making a decision. You should make sure that the source is available before calling this function and it should only be called inside synchronous streaming loop callback such as `on_frame`!
- `id` (of type `() -> string`): Identifier of the source.
- `insert_metadata` (of type `(?new_track : bool, [string * string]) -> unit`): Dynamically insert metadata in a stream. Inserts a new track with the given metadata if `new_track` is `true`.
- `is_active` (of type `() -> bool`): `true` if the source is active, i.e. it is continuously animated by its own clock whenever it is ready. Typically, `true` for outputs and sources such as `input.http`.
- `is_ready` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate if a source is ready to stream. This does not mean that the source is currently streaming, just that its resources are all properly initialized.
- `is_up` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate that the source can be asked to produce some data at any time. This is `true` when the source is currently being used or if it could be used at any time, typically inside a `switch` or `fallback`.
- `last_metadata` (of type `() -> [string * string]?`): Return the last metadata from the source.
- `log` (of type `{level : (() -> int).{set : (int) -> unit}}`): Get or set the source's log level, from `1` to `5`.
- `register_command` (of type `(?usage : string?, description : string, string, ((string) -> string)) ->
unit`): Register a server command for this source. Command is registered under the source's id namespace when it gets up and de-registered when it gets down.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `reset_last_metadata_on_track` (of type `(() -> bool).{set : (bool) -> unit}`): If `true`, the source's `last_metadata` is reset on each new track. If a metadata is present along with the track mark, then it becomes the new `last_metadata`, otherwise, `last_metadata becomes `null`.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controlling its own real-time loop.
- `self_sync_description` (of type `() -> string`)
- `skip` (of type `() -> unit`): Skip to the next track.
- `time` (of type `() -> float`): Get a source's time, based on its assigned clock.

Callbacks:

- `on_frame` (of type `(?before : bool, synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on frame. When `before` is `true`, callback is executed before computing the frame and after otherwise
- `on_frame_checksum` (of type `(?before : ((string?) -> unit)?, synchronous : bool,
 ((cache : string?, string) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler Register callbacks to compute frame checksums for debugging purposes. This is useful to track frame content changes through the streaming pipeline. The `before` callback is called before computing the frame with the checksum of the cached frame (if any, `null` otherwise). The main callback is called after computing the frame with the checksum of the generated frame and the remaining cache (if any).
- `on_metadata` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to execute on each metadata
- `on_position` (of type `(position : {float}, ?remaining : bool, ?allow_partial : bool,
 synchronous : bool, ((float, [string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track position. If `remaining` is `false`, callback is executed when position in track is more or equal to `position`. If `remaining` is `true`, callback is executed when remaining time in the current track is less or equal to `position`. Keep in mind that elapsed time is exact while remaining time is always estimated. Remaining time is usually more accurate for file-based sources. When `allow_partial` is `true`, if the current track ends before the `offset` position is reached, callback is still executed
- `on_shutdown` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called when source shuts down
- `on_track` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track marks
- `on_wake_up` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called after the source is asked to get ready

### `amplify` {#amplify}

### `defer.pcm_s16` {#defer.pcm_s16}

Defer the source's audio track by a given amount of time. Source will be available when the given `delay` has been fully buffered. Use this operator instead of `buffer` when buffering large amount of data as initial delay.

This operator uses a source already using `pcm_s16` audio data. It can be used to prevent unneeded data copy. Typically, decoders that know how to decode to `pcm_s16` (like `ffmpeg`) will decode directly into the format and encoders who support it (also `%ffmpeg`) will encoder directly from the `pcm_s16` data. Use `defer` if you prefer a more user-friendly operator.

Type:

```
(?id : string?, frequency : float, ?order : int, source(audio=pcm('a), 'b)) ->
source(audio=pcm('a), 'b)
```

Arguments:

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `null`): Force the value of the source ID.
- `frequency` (of type `float`): Corner frequency
- `order` (of type `int`, which defaults to `4`): Filter order
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `source(audio=pcm('a), 'b)`)

Methods:

- `buffered` (of type `() -> [string * float]`): Length of buffered data.
- `clock` (of type `clock`): The source's clock
- `duration` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of the duration of the current track.
- `elapsed` (of type `() -> float`): Elapsed time in the current track.
- `fallible` (of type `bool`): Indicate if a source may fail, i.e. may not be ready to stream.
- `generate_frame` (of type `() -> unit`): Generate a frame from the source without consuming it. This can be useful in advanced cases where generating a frame is required to trigger some side effect like calculating some metadata before making a decision. You should make sure that the source is available before calling this function and it should only be called inside synchronous streaming loop callback such as `on_frame`!
- `id` (of type `() -> string`): Identifier of the source.
- `insert_metadata` (of type `(?new_track : bool, [string * string]) -> unit`): Dynamically insert metadata in a stream. Inserts a new track with the given metadata if `new_track` is `true`.
- `is_active` (of type `() -> bool`): `true` if the source is active, i.e. it is continuously animated by its own clock whenever it is ready. Typically, `true` for outputs and sources such as `input.http`.
- `is_ready` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate if a source is ready to stream. This does not mean that the source is currently streaming, just that its resources are all properly initialized.
- `is_up` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate that the source can be asked to produce some data at any time. This is `true` when the source is currently being used or if it could be used at any time, typically inside a `switch` or `fallback`.
- `last_metadata` (of type `() -> [string * string]?`): Return the last metadata from the source.
- `log` (of type `{level : (() -> int).{set : (int) -> unit}}`): Get or set the source's log level, from `1` to `5`.
- `register_command` (of type `(?usage : string?, description : string, string, ((string) -> string)) ->
unit`): Register a server command for this source. Command is registered under the source's id namespace when it gets up and de-registered when it gets down.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `reset_last_metadata_on_track` (of type `(() -> bool).{set : (bool) -> unit}`): If `true`, the source's `last_metadata` is reset on each new track. If a metadata is present along with the track mark, then it becomes the new `last_metadata`, otherwise, `last_metadata becomes `null`.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controlling its own real-time loop.

- `on_frame_checksum` (of type `(?before : ((string?) -> unit)?, synchronous : bool,
 ((cache : string?, string) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler Register callbacks to compute frame checksums for debugging purposes. This is useful to track frame content changes through the streaming pipeline. The `before` callback is called before computing the frame with the checksum of the cached frame (if any, `null` otherwise). The main callback is called after computing the frame with the checksum of the generated frame and the remaining cache (if any).
- `on_metadata` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to execute on each metadata
- `on_position` (of type `(position : {float}, ?remaining : bool, ?allow_partial : bool,
 synchronous : bool, ((float, [string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track position. If `remaining` is `false`, callback is executed when position in track is more or equal to `position`. If `remaining` is `true`, callback is executed when remaining time in the current track is less or equal to `position`. Keep in mind that elapsed time is exact while remaining time is always estimated. Remaining time is usually more accurate for file-based sources. When `allow_partial` is `true`, if the current track ends before the `offset` position is reached, callback is still executed
- `on_shutdown` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called when source shuts down

### `normalize` {#normalize}

Normalization the volume of a stream (this is also called _automatic gain control_). Dynamic normalization of the signal is sometimes the only option (for instance, for live sources), and can make a listening experience much nicer. However, its dynamic aspect implies some limitations which can go as far as creating saturation in some extreme cases. If possible, consider using some track-based normalization techniques such as those based on ReplayGain. The implementation of Liquidsoap < 2.0 was renamed to `normalize.old`.

Type:

```
(?id : string?, ?target : {float}, ?up : {float}, ?down : {float},
 ?gain_min : float, ?gain_max : float, ?lufs : bool, ?lookahead : {float},
 ?window : {float}, ?threshold : {float}, ?track_sensitive : bool,
 ?enabled : {bool}, ?debug : float??, source(audio=pcm('a), 'b)) ->

where 'b is a set of tracks to be muxed into a source
```

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `null`): Force the value of the source ID.
- `target` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `-13.0`): Desired RMS (dB).

- `lookahead` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `0.0`): How much time to look ahead of the signal (second). Setting a positive value delays the output by the corresponding amount of time.

- `threshold` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `-40.0`): Minimal RMS for activaing gain control (dB).

- `log` (of type `{level : (() -> int).{set : (int) -> unit}}`): Get or set the source's log level, from `1` to `5`.
- `register_command` (of type `(?usage : string?, description : string, string, ((string) -> string)) ->
unit`): Register a server command for this source. Command is registered under the source's id namespace when it gets up and de-registered when it gets down.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `reset_last_metadata_on_track` (of type `(() -> bool).{set : (bool) -> unit}`): If `true`, the source's `last_metadata` is reset on each new track. If a metadata is present along with the track mark, then it becomes the new `last_metadata`, otherwise, `last_metadata becomes `null`.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controlling its own real-time loop.

Callbacks:

- `on_frame` (of type `(?before : bool, synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on frame. When `before` is `true`, callback is executed before computing the frame and after otherwise
- `on_frame_checksum` (of type `(?before : ((string?) -> unit)?, synchronous : bool,
 ((cache : string?, string) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler Register callbacks to compute frame checksums for debugging purposes. This is useful to track frame content changes through the streaming pipeline. The `before` callback is called before computing the frame with the checksum of the cached frame (if any, `null` otherwise). The main callback is called after computing the frame with the checksum of the generated frame and the remaining cache (if any).
- `on_metadata` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to execute on each metadata
- `on_position` (of type `(position : {float}, ?remaining : bool, ?allow_partial : bool,
 synchronous : bool, ((float, [string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on track position. If `remaining` is `false`, callback is executed when position in track is more or equal to `position`. If `remaining` is `true`, callback is executed when remaining time in the current track is less or equal to `position`. Keep in mind that elapsed time is exact while remaining time is always estimated. Remaining time is usually more accurate for file-based sources. When `allow_partial` is `true`, if the current track ends before the `offset` position is reached, callback is still executed
- `on_shutdown` (of type `(synchronous : bool, (() -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler to be called when source shuts down
